Idea: Hosting a budget webapp on a RasbPI/Laptop server. 

What's left: actually implementing the flows
On Input/Trans (Add, Up, Remove)
    should update the respective accounts appropraitely
Should update Data.rb to Accounts.rb and actually access the database to error check
Should update database so account name is unique, transaction/input tables have a primary key "id"
    instead of using rowid for up/delete
Should make a decision on Categories vs accounts and standardize
Should build UI
Should add a class that handles the database formats/building hashes/arrays to insert


Base everything off the idea of a transaction.
Every cashflow has a transaction
Transaction:
    - name
    - description
    - date/time
    - amount (dollars, cents)
    - category: (has to match category in category table)
                HOUSING, CAR, FOOD, MISC, GIVING, FUN, 

CLI:
    - output transaction from account
        - takes: (hash) {name, date, desc, amount, category}
    - input transaction into account
        - takes: (hash) {name date total, (multiple)category => amount }
    - breakdown view overview of expenses breakdown
        - takes: (hash) { month, 6month, year, ytd, custom [date_range] }
    - list recent transactions in a table
        - takes: (hash) { limit [num], month, date [range_start, range_end] }
    - add category
        - takes: (hash) {name, type, balance, target}
    - update category
        - takes: (hash) {name, type, balance, target}
    - remove category
        - takes: name
    - edit transaction
        - takes: trans_num, (hash) {name, date, desc, amount, category}
    - remove transaction
        - takes: trans_num
    - edit input
    - remove input

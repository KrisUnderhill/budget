Idea: Hosting a budget webapp on a RasbPI/Laptop server. 

Base everything off the idea of a transaction.
Every cashflow has a transaction
Transaction:
    - name
    - description
    - date/time
    - amount (dollars, cents)
    - category: (has to match category in category table)
                HOUSING, CAR, FOOD, MISC, GIVING, FUN, 

CLI:
    - output transaction from account
        - takes: (hash) {name, date, desc, amount, category}
    - input transaction into account
        - takes: (hash) {name date total, (multiple)category => amount }
    - breakdown view overview of expenses breakdown
        - takes: (hash) { month, 6month, year, ytd, custom [date_range] }
    - list recent transactions in a table
        - takes: (hash) { limit [num], month, date [range_start, range_end] }
    - add category
        - takes: (hash) {name, type, balance, target}
    - update category
        - takes: (hash) {name, type, balance, target}
    - remove category
        - takes: name
    - edit transaction
        - takes: trans_num, (hash) {name, date, desc, amount, category}
    - remove transaction
        - takes: trans_num

Idea: Hosting a budget webapp on a RasbPI/Laptop server. 

Base everything off the idea of a transaction.
Every cashflow has a transaction
Transaction:
    has a:
        - name
        - description
        - date/time
        - amount (dollars, cents)
        - category: HOUSING, CAR, FOOD, MISC, GIVING, FUN, 

CLI:
    can:
        - insert transaction into table
        - read [timeperiod] expenses defaults to monthly shortcuts to 6M, year to date, 12 M, calendar year
        - overview/breakdown view overview of expenses breakdown
